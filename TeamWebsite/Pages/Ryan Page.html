My name is Ryan Wiskirchen, and I am currently a student in the Gaming, Interactive Media, 
Mobility (GIMM) program at Boise State University. 
I have a background in Mechanical Engineering, and have worked in a variety of fields.  
I have worked in the automotive and finance industries, and in multiple lab settings.  I am a non-traditional student.  
I am probably the oldest student in the program, and I might even be older than a few of the professors.  
I truly enjoy learning.In my free time (which I donâ€™t have much of), I enjoy building and creating.  
I have a passion for cars, and hope to be able to restore a classic at some point in my life.  
I also enjoy being outdoors, off-roading, camping, boating, snowboarding, hiking, and more.  
One of the things that makes me feel most accomplished is, being able to make a goal 
to do something (physical or mental) that seems insurmountable, and completing that goal. 
I have a small family, and I would do anything for them.
