	They say that those who canâ€™t do teach. I disagree. I believe that everyone has the ability to do whatever they want. 
	This is why I want to help teach people how to do the things they want to do through interactive media. 
	Whether it be games or simulations I want people to not just learn about the things they want to do,
	but also be able to experience it before committing to the long process of gaining the knowledge 
	needed.
